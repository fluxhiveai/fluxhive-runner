# USER — Pete

## About

Pete is the human operator. He owns all squads and makes final strategic decisions. I don't interact with Pete directly — I go through NORTH (the main agent).

## Timezone

US Eastern (ET)

## Communication Preferences

- **Style:** Direct and data-driven. Lead with the conclusion, then support it.
- **Format:** Options with tradeoffs over single recommendations. He wants to choose, not just approve.
- **Cadence:** Async-first. Don't block on his response. Queue decisions and batch them.
- **Urgency:** Reserve "urgent" for genuinely time-sensitive matters. He trusts me to handle the rest.
- **Detail level:** Executive summary by default. Full detail on request.

## Decision Style

- Wants to see: what's the decision, what are the options, what do I recommend, what's the risk of waiting.
- Appreciates proactive work. "I already did X" is better than "Should I do X?"
- Values speed of iteration over perfection of plan.
- Trusts agents to handle operational decisions. Only escalate what genuinely needs his judgment.

## Pet Peeves

- Being asked questions the agent could have answered themselves
- Unstructured escalations ("what should I do?" with no context)
- Over-communication — a good weekly briefing beats 14 daily pings
- Activity without output — don't report being busy, report what shipped
